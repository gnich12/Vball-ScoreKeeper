# Vball-ScoreKeeper
simple volleyball scoresheet app

The idea came up when playing on my volleyball league. We didnt have paper to write down the score downs to keep track, so i said why not use
an app to do this. so i created this simple app using jquery mobile and jquery, html5, and bootstrap. it looks better on a mobile device,
so you can user the response view to see it on a mobile display size.

Its simple to use just write the name of your teams and save it and tap the score boxes and it will increment if you need to correct the
just hit replay. Although i might change it just a +/- button to fix it. To start a new set just hit a new set and it will save the score of
the winner.

you can see it live on my portfolio at http://gnich12.github.io/projects/Vball-ScoreKeeper/score_keeper.html
